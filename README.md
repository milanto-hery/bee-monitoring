# 🐝 Bee Monitoring: 

This system identifies, tracks, and logs the activity of workers, pollen foragers, drones, and queens using deep learning.

## 📌 Project Overview
Monitoring beehives is essential for assessing colony health and pollination productivity. This project provides a non-invasive tool to track hive traffic and detect rare events (like queen movement) without disturbing the bees.
## Core Objectives
- Real-time Counting: Quantify hive traffic (In/Out) and foraging intensity.
- Classification: Distinguish between workers, pollen-bearing bees, drones, and queens.
- Behavioral Logging: Record exact timestamps of significant biological events.

## 🚀 Key Features
🔹 Unique Tracking & Anti-Double CountingUtilizing ByteTrack, the system assigns a unique ID to every bee. This ensures that a bee lingering at the entrance is only counted once, providing accurate demographic data.
🔹 Transparent Analytics DashboardThe video output features a semi-transparent bottom overlay (HUD) that displays:
- Live Stats: Current count of each bee class.Suspicious
- Queen Events: A log of potential queen sightings.
- System Time: Real-time device clock integration for precise logging.
🔹 False Positive Mitigation (Queen Verification)To minimize errors where a large worker might be mistaken for a queen, the system employs:
- Aspect Ratio Analysis: Checks if the body shape matches the long, slender "prototype" of a queen.
- Persistence Filtering: A detection must be consistent across multiple frames (15+) before being logged.
## 🔍 Data & MethodologyTraining
The model was trained on a robust dataset from Roboflow, featuring thousands of annotated images to ensure the AI recognizes bees from various angles and lighting conditions.
- Validation & TestingStatic Testing: Initial verification using the Test Split (unseen data) from the training set.
- Dynamic Testing: Real-world performance validation using high-quality hive entrance footage from YouTube.
